        How I built design into the culture of Thinkific.
      </h5>
    </div>    

    <p>
      When I joined Thinkific we were 5 people. The app still had a cartoon waffle in the main navigation, we barely had any users, and customers couldn&rsquo;t even pay us. It was early days.

    <p>
      Joining so early as the only designer meant I basically had carte blanche to define what design meant for the company. My goal right from the start was to establish design as more than just pretty interfaces on a screen. Don’t get me wrong, pretty interfaces are great, but I wanted to build design into the fabric of the company because I felt that’s what it would take to make Thinkific into a product that really mattered to people.
    </p>
    <p>So where do you start when you have an empty canvas?</p>

    <!-- First Story -->
    <h5 class="story__section-header">
      Become user obsessed
    </h5>
    <p>
      I decided my first order of business at Thinkific was straight up politics. I needed my fellow Thinkificers (Thinkificos? Thinkificees?) to see design they way I saw it. I needed them to see that it was more than colours and fonts, that it could actually define how we build features and product and that it was a critical part of making customers happy enough to stick around and pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the company had a pretty solid product in place I knew if Thinkific was going to reach its full potential, we needed to become user obsessed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    &ldquo;I knew if Thinkific was going to reach its full potential, we needed to become user obsessed.&rdquo;
  </blockquote>
  <div class="story__column">    
    <p>
      A truly user obsessed culture needs to centre around speaking to clients as the cornerstone of its design process. Everyone in the company had to make customers the focus of every conversation, and the key to how we learned &mdash; before a single design was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt the best way to start everyone else on the path to user obsession was by showing the team how valuable a customer conversation could be. By speaking to customers, we would not only better understood their needs, we would also tap into their thought process. The answers we needed weren't in the office, as they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invited other members of the team along as I conducted interviews with real customers. Together we asked customers about their experience on the platform, we asked them what they were struggling with, what they liked, what their goals were, and tons more.
    </p>

    </figure>
  <div class="story__column">
    <p>
      We learned A LOT. To summarize weeks of calls, these people were experts at other stuff &mdash; they were sailing coaches, painters, or math teachers &mdash; they didn&rsquo;t want become web designers or a marketing experts to sell courses. They just wanted to teach their skills and earn some income. The messages resonated loud and clear, and the team was also seeing how important these types of conversations were.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also learned that our app wasn&rsquo;t making sense from a UX perspective. As I watched customers interact with the product, I saw that any action they took felt like a thousand little paper cuts. It was common for users to find confusing clusters of buttons or entire pages that worked against their every move. On top of all that, the design looked outdated. The app felt like it was punishing anyone that was trying to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all extremely important feedback for the team and we would get around to fixing most it, but the most important outcome for the company at the time was the shift in how design was perceived. Hearing from customers about all these things we had never noticed or overlooked was almost shocking to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden it was no longer about just making interfaces, it was about people and the problem we were solving for them. Conversations about user journeys and needs were a part of every feature plan. There was no going back, everyone was obsessed and all it took was a few phone calls.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Story -->
    <h5 class="story__section-header">
      Create an environment
    </h5>
    <p>
      I had never built a team before, but I knew when we started hiring other designers that I wanted to create a unique environment for people instead of just another job. I wanted to do this because it felt like the best way to allow people to do their best work and make Thinkific the best it could possibly be. I started by creating a place where I wanted to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to work in a place that followed a few simple principles. Be encouraging, be open, and take ownership. While these principals were never explicitly expressed (they should have been), they were ingrained in the way the team interacted, because they are naturally the way I work. Each one was important.
    </p>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    &ldquo;I wanted to work in a place that followed a few simple principles. Be encouraging, be open, and take ownership.&rdquo;
  </blockquote>
  <div class="story__column">
    <p>
      Be encouraging. This didn&rsquo;t mean everyone blindly acted like a cheerleader for anything that got done on the team. It meant that any member of the team was encouraged to take risks and try things out. There was never a slap on the wrist waiting for someone if they decided take a chance and it turned out badly. Designers didn&rsquo;t need to ask to take a chance, they knew they could experiment even if it meant a little scope increase or ending up in the wrong place at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be open. Openesses meant that ideas and discussions were open to anyone regardless of title. The opinion and ideas of an intermediate graphic designer on the marketing team were seen as equal to that of a senior member of the product team. This created an environment where people felt welcome to share, and wouldn&rsquo;t feel judged even if their idea missed the mark by a country mile. This openness created a great environment for learning without any defensiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take ownership. Taking ownership wasn&rsquo;t about accountability, it was about the designers having the independence to make decisions for themselves by taking ownership of the project. During my career I have been lucky enough never to have a micromanaging leader, which meant I have often had the autonomy to explore and make decisions (mistakes) for myself and really own anything I did. I wanted to continue working that way. Support was there if designers needed it, but nobody held anyone&rsquo;s hand. I think this is an amazing way to build confidence in more junior designers.
    </p>
  </div>
    <figure class="story__image-container">

    </figure>
  <div class="story__column">
    <p>
      So what did these principals do for our team? They gave us an culture of genuine trust. I fully trusted every other designer on that team. I knew that whenever someone asked for feedback on a piece of work, or we talked about the future of design at the company that the team had everyone&rsquo;s best interest and the best interests of the users at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without worrying about the other members of team, everyone was free to bring ideas and do the best work they were capable of.
    </p>

    <h5 class="story__section-header">
      Make everyone a designer.
    </h5>
    <p>When I was an inexperienced designer, I used to hide my work and shun people from looking at it until it was &lsquo;ready&rsquo;. This of course meant my work was terrible and often missed the mark. Thankfully over the course of my career I learned that just the opposite was the key to success. </p>

    <p>So from the very start of my time at Thinkific, I set out to build a culture of inclusiveness around design. People were called upon for their ideas, conversations were open and inviting, and most importantly anyone could hold the whiteboard marker. What better way to build a culture of design than make everyone a designer.</p>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    &ldquo;What better way to build a culture of design than make everyone a designer.&rdquo;
  </blockquote>
  <div class="story__column">
    <p>This inclusiveness was responsible for some serious high-five sessions and some equally tough conversations, but it always resulted in a better experience for the customer.</p>

    <p>However, keeping this culture alive isn&rsquo;t easy when everyone is busy with their actual job. As the company grew it just wasn’t possible for everyone to be deeply involved they way they were in the early days, which was going to affect the quality of the user experience if we weren&rsquo;t careful. </p>

    <p>One of the ways I fought to keep this collaborative spirit alive was though Design Sprints and similar co-creation exercises. It allowed people to have their voices and amazing ideas heard in a concentrated format that allowed them to keep doing their actual jobs. A team of 7 people could suddenly feel as cohesive as a team of 3, and produce enough ideas to keep me hunched over my keyboard for weeks. </p>
  </div>
  <figure class="story__image-container">
    <img src="assets/img/design-process.png" alt="Product development workflow">
    <figcaption>
      Our inclusive product development process. This was fit into a agile workflow.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div class="story__column">
    <p>I also experimented with getting developers to join on design oriented customer calls. Having a developer in the room when testing a prototype would often yield amazing insights usability, or how the idea might be brought to life in code. It also deepened the level of conversation around any features we were building. Instead of just talking about our ideas and opinions everyone on the team was referencing customer calls. </p>

    <p>Eventually as we grew and the process of creating features became more formalized, cooperation was present at every stage. Teams outside of product were involved early and helped bring the feature to life. Everyone had input.</p>

    <p>This culture of cooperation without a doubt had a massive impact on the quality of the product. There is no way that a single designer working on a platform that serves thousands of people could understand every deep crevice within the user&rsquo;s journey. It takes a village to build something amazing.</p>

    <h5 class="story__section-header">
      The culmination of culture
    </h5>
    <p>When I step back and look at where Thinkific is today, it doesn&rsquo;t look anything like it did in when I started. The company has grown in many ways, the staff, the number of customers, the revenue and all of the cultural habits that were built early on. These cultures still help Thinkific do things like hire the right people, and build a product that matters. I certainly didn’t understand the power of culture back when we started, but now it’s impossible for me to ignore.</p>

    <p>Building a culture of user obsession allowed us to identify the right things our users needed to succeed. </p>

    <p>Building a culture around openness and trust allowed the designers to do their best possible work and build those things our users needed.</p>

    <p>
    Building a culture around inclusiveness allowed us to make sure that we kept building the right things no matter how big we were. </p>

    <p>Building culture helped turn Thinkific into a company that changes lives.</p>
